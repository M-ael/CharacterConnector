# CharacterConnector

A website for adding nodes and connections for graphing character relations in a story. Originally created to graph character relations in ReZero, a story where irl references to mythology and astronomy play an important role.

## Features:

- Add nodes

Nodes can be given names and descriptions and are supposed to represent characters. Node descriptions are divided into "Story" and "Reference"; information about the characters in the story goes in "Story", information about their respective references (allusions) goes in "Reference". You are of course free to use any of these features however you like too.

- Connect nodes

By holding down Ctrl and clicking on 2 different nodes, you can create connections. These serve to relate different characters with one another. For example, if 2 characters are in love with each other, you might create a connection and use a heart as the symbol for the connection. You can give connections titles (the first letter is used as the connection symbol) and short descriptions.

- Exporting and Importing Canvases

You can export canvases with all their nodes and connections and open (import) them anywhere else. This allows sharing created canvases.
